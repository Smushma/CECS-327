To compile the java files (via CLI and assuming you have set up your JDK path):
javac UDPServer.java
javac UDPClient.java

To run the server, enter a port number as follows:
java UDPServer <port>
EX:
java UDPServer 6789
To kill the server, Ctrl + C in the command line

To run the client, the command format is:
java UDPClient <ip-address> <port> <message>
EX:
java UDPClient 192.168.111.111 9999 "CECS 327"
